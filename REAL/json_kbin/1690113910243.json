By understanding other people‚Äôs arguments, you understand why they do what they do ‚Äì and have a better chance of persuading them.","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://fedinews.net/media/0e/80/0e80ea98deeebb227056b46ab62490c044b47431d581dd67cef7816b936b8ab0.png","published":"2023-07-21T16:44:54+00:00","updated":"2023-07-23T03:19:16+00:00","followers":1,"time":1690084033493},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/constellationstepfoxhub","title":"constellationstepfoxhub","name":"constellationstepfoxhub","preferred":"constellationstepfoxhub","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-19T18:06:58+00:00","updated":"2023-06-19T18:06:58+00:00","followers":1,"time":1690085987490},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/Fermented","title":"Fermented","name":"Fermented","preferred":"Fermented","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"A place to talk about fermented foods.","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-13T16:36:23+00:00","updated":"2023-07-08T22:00:36+00:00","followers":4,"time":1690085128311},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/realme","title":"realme Community","name":"realme","preferred":"realme","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"A place for the Kbin Community to discuss about realme and its products.","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-12T09:45:57+00:00","updated":"2023-06-12T09:45:57+00:00","followers":2,"time":1690085296205},{"actor_id":"https://wiku.hu/m/BizzBennemMernokVagyok","title":"B√≠zz bennem, m√©rn√∂k vagyok","name":"BizzBennemMernokVagyok","preferred":"BizzBennemMernokVagyok","baseurl":"wiku.hu","summary":"A B√≠zz bennem, m√©rn√∂k vagyok Facebook oldal hivatalos Wiku magazinja.

For those giving feedback, please give constructive criticism.\r\n\r\n[Resource] - This tag will serve to identify tools (software/apps, guides, repositories, etc) to help people create characters. Also what you should use if you have some personal tips or tricks you'd like to share.\r\n\r\n[Show and Tell] - Feeling proud? Use this tag to show off a character you've created. Also great if you have an image.\r\n\r\n[Challenge] or [Contest] Want to issue a summons for other Forgers to test their and their characters' mettle in a situation? How about creating a character with given constraints? Put forth a Challenge.\r\n\r\n[Discussion] or [Talk] Want to start a discussion about something topical? Something not quite \"meta\" enough, like sparking discussion about other Forgers' characters? Discussing best practices?

His delusions include him believing he is a world famous rapper and household name. He claims to have acquired savant syndrome from a head injury sustained in highschool. (That he did not graduate and was kicked out at the age of 23, the max age in the state of Ohio.) Because of this, he claims to be a musical genius who plays \"pitch perfect\" guitar, violin, keyboard, drums, (two coffee cans that he claims sounds identical to real drums) and just about any other instrument as soon as he picks it up. Of course, all of this is in his head and reality is very VERY different.\r\n\r\nNot only is he the most talented music artist and one of the best rappers out there, even better than Eminem, (yes, he said this) he is also a professional e-racer, (despite never driving a real car because he is afraid) a professional game developer, (despite not knowing how to program, or model, or draw, or anything) a \"real thug\"/gangster, (despite getting his ass kicked, letting out the whimpiest, most girliest yelp ever, and screaming for his mom) a dancer, an artist, (despite tracing and stealing just about all of his art) and many other claims. In reality, he is good at nothing because he puts no effort into actually learning anything.\r\n\r\nChance LOVES to project his faults on everyone else. If he is calling you something, the odds are he is really talking about himself.\r\n\r\nBe Aware: Interacting with the goblin might cause him to send you pictures or videos of his infected penis. Especially if you are a minor.\r\n\r\nMore soon...\r\nLinks:\r\n\r\nMusic Biz Marty\r\nWilliam Gloryhole\r\nCyraxx Archive\r\n","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/e4/df/e4dfa4412ed13f80b8596d7a407b3ea333fdcf8784fe458ec984ce37cdee7dd0.png","published":"2023-06-23T01:21:22+00:00","updated":"2023-07-04T02:19:54+00:00","followers":1,"time":1690085771736},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/somerville","title":"Somerville, Massachusetts","name":"somerville","preferred":"somerville","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"For residents and fans of\nAssembly Square\r\nBall Square\r\nBrickbottom\nClarendon Hill\nDavis Square\r\nDuck Village\nEast Somerville\nGilman Square\nInner Belt District\r\nMagoun Square\r\nNunnery Grounds\nPowder House Square\r\nProspect Hill\nSpring Hill\r\nThe States\nTeele Square\r\nTen Hills\r\nTufts\r\nUnion Square\r\nWilson Square\nWinter Hill","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-13T01:08:09+00:00","updated":"2023-07-20T19:22:00+00:00","followers":27,"time":1690112739146},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/fictionalfauna","title":"Fictional Fauna","name":"fictionalfauna","preferred":"fictionalfauna","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"A community for sharing works of fictional fauna.

Anything released in the past 2 months or to be released within 2 weeks counts. Using spoiler tags is allowed for any and all spoilers.\r\n\r\nAdvertising must not be more than 20% of your post history. You get one warning.\r\n\r\nMemes are now only allowed on Mondays.\r\nGuidelines and Notes\r\n\r\nAll rules are subject to moderator discretion. If you have an issue with any moderator action, please message the mods and we will discuss it.\r\nThe only mandatory stipulations on language are that no slurs are used. This means that curse words are allowed. However, please be aware that Bionicle is marketed towards children, and is a Lego toy. Swearing should not be unnecessary or directed towards any user(s).\r\nIf a Lego Ideas entry has been gaining traction, there will be a single post made for it, and all others will be removed until either the Ideas entry dies, or reaches its goal, at which time either the OP can make a celebratory post, or a staff member will if the OP does not appear to have a reddit account.\r\nAll art, images of MOCs, etc, must be your own, or include the author's name in the title. Source must be listed in the comments.\r\nMore rules may be added, revised, or removed at future dates. If you do something egregious that isn't against any current rules, it may still be removed and you may be penalized.\r\nF.A.Q\r\nHere's a quick FAQ, which will be slowly expanded on in the future. I use the FAQ post stickied to the front page as a base for this, so check that if you want more up-to-date information.\r\n\r\nQ. Where can I get Bionicle pieces and/or sets?\r\nA. Bricklink, Brickowl, Ebay, and Craigslist(or local equivalent) are good places to look.\r\n\r\nQ. Where can I find a specific piece?\r\n\r\nA. All Lego pieces(save a few, insubstantial number) have ID numbers on them. Look for that number, and search for it on sites like Bricklink.\r\n\r\nQ. How can I join the Discord server?\r\n\r\nA. Click Here! If you need help, please DM me directly either here on reddit, or via Discord. My username is Ginko#1840.\r\n\r\nQ. When is the next contest?\r\n\r\nA. Depends. I try to keep it on schedule, but I also have a life outside of reddit, so sometimes(often) I'm a bit late.\r\n\r\nQ. How much is my set/mask worth?\r\n\r\nA. Check with Bricklink, or join our discord. We have some collectors who could probably help you with this if you need.\r\n\r\nQ. What are some digital designers I can use to build and design MOCs?\r\n\r\nA. Lego's LDD, or Lego Digital Designer is a common and popular one, but does not have much variety of Bionicle parts. Stud.io, found on Bricklink, is a newer option that would be better recommended to Bionicle fans.\r\n\r\nL. LDD\r\nL. Stud.io\r\n\r\nQ. Where can I start learning about the lore?\r\n\r\nA. We have a lore-specific channel on our Discord. There's also BioSector01, which we highly recommend over the Bionicle Wikia, which has been known to be incorrect, and allegedly used for personal fan-canons, not official canons.\r\n\r\nQ. Where's the link for the wildly popular Bionicle set on Lego Ideas?\r\n\r\nA.

Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, ‚Äúfree software‚Äù is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of ‚Äúfree‚Äù as in ‚Äúfree speech,‚Äù not as in ‚Äúfree beer.‚Äù We sometimes call it ‚Äúlibre software,‚Äù borrowing the French or Spanish word for ‚Äúfree‚Äù as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.\r\n\r\nWe campaign for these freedoms because everyone deserves them. With these freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control the program and what it does for them. When users don't control the program, we call it a ‚Äúnonfree‚Äù or ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù program. The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program; this makes the program an instrument of unjust power.\n‚ÄúOpen source‚Äù is something different: it has a very different philosophy based on different values.

It combines elements of anarchism, which rejects centralized authority, and capitalism, which emphasizes the free market and individual ownership.\r\n\r\nIn an anarcho-capitalist society, all goods, services, and resources would be privately owned and operated, with no government intervention or regulation. The philosophy holds that individuals should be free to engage in voluntary transactions and contracts without interference from a central authority. Supporters argue that this would lead to greater personal freedom, economic prosperity, and social harmony.\r\n\r\nThe state, with its monopoly on violence and its ability to impose laws and regulations, is inherently coercive and infringes upon individual liberties. The free market, driven by competition and voluntary interactions, is the most efficient and just system for allocating resources and satisfying people's needs and desires.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of anarcho-capitalism lies in its emphasis on individual freedom and the reduction of government power. Without a centralized authority, people would be able to make their own choices regarding economic activities, contracts, and personal lifestyles. Removing government intervention would eliminate corruption, inefficiencies, and inequalities that arise from political power structures.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, private ownership and voluntary interactions would encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Without government regulations and restrictions, businesses would be able to operate more freely and respond more efficiently to market demands. This, in turn, could lead to increased prosperity and overall wealth creation.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the appeal of anarcho-capitalism varies among individuals based on their views on the role of government, individual autonomy, and economic organization. It's a philosophy that sparks intense discussions and debates about the ideal balance between freedom and collective well-being in society.","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-12T22:28:49+02:00","updated":"2023-06-12T22:28:49+02:00","followers":6,"time":1690083125474},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/DecidingToBeBetter","title":"DecidingToBeBetter@kbin.social","name":"DecidingToBeBetter","preferred":"DecidingToBeBetter","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"A force for self-improvement, goodness, and togetherness that helps humanity eliminate evil.

Your OC is not only recommended, but highly encouraged!\r\n\r\nWhat is S Scale?\r\n\r\nS scale is defined as 1:64 in model railroading, but the scale is useful in many more scenarios. For example, many tabletop miniature games use 1:60 scale, where 1 inch at the table represents 5 feet in-game. This doesn't exactly line up with stud widths, but 3 studs are just under 1 inch (0.945 in.) Creations at this scale would technically be 1:63.5 scale.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, this magazine will try to foster not just a gallery of users' creations at near-S scale, but also hopes to be a forum for lively discussions on techniques used by creators, and even a place to show off how these S scale creations are being used in games or other scenarios.\r\n\r\nUnit Conversion for 1:63.5 Scale:\r\n\r\n|LEGO units|Imperial units|Metric units|\r\n:--|:--|:--|\r\n|1 stud|1 ft 8 in|50.8 cm|\r\n|1 plate|8 in|20.32 cm|\r\n|1 brick|2 ft|60.96 cm|","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/2d/c0/2dc08a979ef6c1ed45767daa953829683922ed66ad2871e462e34a0fcacbb030.webp","published":"2023-06-13T16:05:06+00:00","updated":"2023-07-10T01:04:10+00:00","followers":7,"time":1690084705762},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/ColumbiaSC","title":"Home of Columbia SC","name":"ColumbiaSC","preferred":"ColumbiaSC","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"Posts and news related to Columbia SC","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-10T13:45:39+00:00","updated":"2023-06-10T13:45:39+00:00","followers":3,"time":1690085145698},{"actor_id":"https://fedia.io/m/PatientGamers","title":"Patient Gamers","name":"PatientGamers","preferred":"PatientGamers","baseurl":"fedia.io","summary":"We'll play that, eventually.","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://fedia.io/media/3c/29/3c2995c231dda94cc466d16eea48fdede9a9fa50eb51921bea85ec6c7182643f.webp","published":"2023-06-13T12:22:27+02:00","updated":"2023-07-20T18:46:39+02:00","followers":96,"time":1690082962274},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/Japan","title":"Japan","name":"Japan","preferred":"Japan","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/9f/ef/9fef625c69fcea82ce5ed21f28b3a181e7f5fccf822a5d3af8d972be04ff5799.jpg","published":"2023-06-13T05:21:57+00:00","updated":"2023-07-22T15:30:09+00:00","followers":92,"time":1690112526478},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/literature","title":"kbin Literature Club!","name":"literature","preferred":"literature","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"Literature is love!

We also make no distinction between drugs regarding their legal status (prescription vs. street) or their method of obtainment (doctor or pusher/dealer).\r\n\r\nOur First Step gives us one focus: our addiction. The wording of which takes the focus of our powerlessness off the symptom and places it squarely on the disease itself. This has nothing to do with \"drug of choice.\" NA's First Step applies regardless of drug of choice and length of clean time.\r\n\r\nIf drug-specific sharing is what you desire, we suggest you look in another community, perhaps the one named after the drug you are asking about.\r\n\r\nWelcome.

Liminal spaces are commonly places of transition (pertaining to the concept of liminality) or of nostalgic appeal.\r\n\r\nResearch from the Journal of Environmental Psychology has indicated that liminal spaces may appear eerie or strange because they fall into an uncanny valley of architecture and physical places.[1] An article from Pulse: the Journal of Science and Culture has attributed this eeriness to familiar places lacking their usually observed context.[2]\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic gained popularity in 2019 after a post on 4chan depicting a liminal space called the Backrooms went viral. Since then, liminal space images have been posted across the internet, including on Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok.\r\n\r\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal_space_(aesthetic)","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.karab.in/e5/c1/e5c1ead98a13683b4a2a8a06c075006692f9243ff91d97a95e28e0af6ad82a18.jpg","published":"2023-05-17T12:59:03+00:00","updated":"2023-06-17T20:06:40+00:00","followers":7,"time":1690112313428},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/ApolloApp","title":"Apollo","name":"ApolloApp","preferred":"ApolloApp","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-15T06:02:33+00:00","updated":"2023-07-03T18:38:58+00:00","followers":25,"time":1690113062902},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/fuckcars","title":"fuckcars","name":"fuckcars","preferred":"fuckcars","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-14T01:12:46+00:00","updated":"2023-07-10T18:34:25+00:00","followers":53,"time":1690112697527},{"actor_id":"https://fedia.io/m/neardeathexperience","title":"Near Death Experiences","name":"neardeathexperience","preferred":"neardeathexperience","baseurl":"fedia.io","summary":"","sensitive":true,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-20T09:14:56+02:00","updated":"2023-06-20T09:14:56+02:00","followers":1,"time":1690083355087},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/trackers","title":"Discussion of public & private trackers","name":"trackers","preferred":"trackers","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"Discuss public and private torrent trackers!

While there are some things that are generally the same, there is no one \"Linux\" - every distro has some things they do different and you'll get better answers if you provide some info.\r\n\r\nAnd remember the people here are helping you purely out of their own good will - so be nice!\r\n\r\nIf you are encountering a problem, please include:\r\n\r\nWhich distro you are using\r\nA brief summary of the problem\r\nAny steps you have attempted\r\nRelevant details such as hardware specs (see below), application versions, etc.\r\nCapturing System Specs\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases, posting output from\r\n\r\n    inxi -Fmz\r\n\r\neither as in a code block, as a linked file, or as a screenshot - will be appreciated. Some distros may pre-install inxi but on others (such as Fedora), you may need to install it yourself. But we understand that there will be times when you are unable to provide this info (such as with boot problems).\r\n\r\nThe output from inxi info should be safe (especially with the -z option)... But in general,YOU SHOULD ALWAYS REVIEW OUTPUT AND REMOVE ANY PRIVATE DATA BEFORE POSTING ONLINE (e.g. replace \"Your Name\" with `` or something similar - this helps in preventing doxxing, identity theft, and similar issues).\r\n\r\nSome common graphical screenshot apps:gnome-screenshot, ksnip, shutter, and flameshot . There are also terminal-based ones like maim and scrot.\r\nThere are plenty of free, text-pasting sites (e.g. pastebin.com) out there that are arguably better than pastebin itself. Any of these should work. We recommend any of the instances of the opensource PrivateBin. But you can find more options listed here.\r\nTo copy text from a terminal app, first open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), then run the command, then to select text hold down the left-mouse and drag to select. Once selected, release left mouse and either press Ctrl+Shift+C or right-click on the selected text and choose \"Copy\" to copy text to clipboard.\nYou can also format the text as a codeblock. To do so, select the text in your post and clicking the icon that looks like a `` symbol. For larger outputs (more than 2-3 lines), it is recommended to add a blank line above and below the output to help with formatting.\r\nRecommended Beginner Distros:\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this is not to say other distros are necessarily \"bad\" for beginners. Linux is not Windows or Mac, so there will be things to adjust to. This list of the distros is what we think users trying Linux for the first time (and presumably having little or no experience with it) will have the easiest times adjust to. It is still recommended to try them and to watch videos on youtube etc.\r\n\r\nNobara Project\r\nLinux Mint\r\nPopOS\r\n\r\nOther kbin communities you may enjoy:\r\n\r\n/m/linux : general Linux news and info\r\n/m/linux_gaming : news and discussion around gaming on Linux\r\n/m/linuxmasterrace : memes and joking around about Linux culture/sub-culture (the name is a play on the \"pc master race\" from some old Zero Punctuation video game reviews)\r\n/m/opensource : discussion and recommendations about open source software","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/18/3b/183bf99d237477e5d6a8403f9d5cafb455b4da94ba770924a0619cdb7dc7ff12.png","published":"2023-06-14T00:46:52+00:00","updated":"2023-07-10T08:58:59+00:00","followers":358,"time":1690112312607},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/Miami","title":"Miami","name":"Miami","preferred":"Miami","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"Official Miami","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-05T17:19:34+00:00","updated":"2023-07-14T00:19:45+00:00","followers":12,"time":1690113245558},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/accessibility","title":"Accessibility","name":"accessibility","preferred":"accessibility","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-05-05T19:32:45+00:00","updated":"2023-07-23T10:42:33+00:00","followers":53,"time":1690112700037},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/drumandbass","title":"Drum'n'Bass music","name":"drumandbass","preferred":"drumandbass","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"All things Drum'n'Bass","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-12T13:45:45+00:00","updated":"2023-07-21T15:06:35+00:00","followers":10,"time":1690113115631},{"actor_id":"https://fedia.io/m/FFXIV","title":"FFXIV","name":"FFXIV","preferred":"FFXIV","baseurl":"fedia.io","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://fedia.io/media/23/19/2319faa68e5321bfc4e2afc7cccde580542d3753f11f87137e781a1e0a039fc0.webp","published":"2023-06-13T12:17:09+02:00","updated":"2023-07-07T20:45:59+02:00","followers":15,"time":1690083063050},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/RugbyUnion","title":"Rugby Union","name":"RugbyUnion","preferred":"RugbyUnion","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-26T08:20:42+00:00","updated":"2023-06-26T08:20:42+00:00","followers":5,"time":1690051649829},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/TearsOfThemis","title":"Tears of Themis","name":"TearsOfThemis","preferred":"TearsOfThemis","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"An unofficial community for Hoyoverse's otome mobile game, Tears of Themis (Êú™ÂÆö‰∫ã‰ª∂Á∞ø).","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/eb/80/eb801069720350bec07e01828881b52808490ae8a05af8ddfa9f11fe12bd467d.png","published":"2023-06-22T09:42:52+00:00","updated":"2023-06-30T18:03:35+00:00","followers":5,"time":1690084851687},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/goodyearwelt","title":"Goodyear Welt - for finely crafted footwear","name":"goodyearwelt","preferred":"goodyearwelt","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"Welcome to the kbin mag for all traditionally-made footwear.\r\n This includes Goodyear welt, stitchdown, Blake, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to be a repository of knowledge and a meeting place for enthusiasts.","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-22T05:29:33+00:00","updated":"2023-07-14T10:03:59+00:00","followers":5,"time":1690084573351},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/elixir","title":"Elixir","name":"elixir","preferred":"elixir","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/c7/d5/c7d5ccaada8c392d60cdcb23d7bd73056393bb3a5d96f6a20051b243e4645169.png","published":"2023-04-28T15:15:25+00:00","updated":"2023-07-17T14:17:59+00:00","followers":38,"time":1690112838115},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/webhosting","title":"WebHosting","name":"webhosting","preferred":"webhosting","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-14T16:03:27+00:00","updated":"2023-07-13T12:43:14+00:00","followers":4,"time":1690084444219},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/UFOs","title":"The UFO/UAP magazine","name":"UFOs","preferred":"UFOs","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"A community for discussion related to Unidentified Flying Objects.

Synthesizers typically create sounds by generating waveforms through methods including subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis and frequency modulation synthesis. These sounds may be altered by components such as filters, which cut or boost frequencies; envelopes, which control articulation, or how notes begin and end; and low-frequency oscillators, which modulate parameters such as pitch, volume, or filter characteristics affecting timbre. Synthesizers are typically played with keyboards or controlled by sequencers, software or other instruments and may be synchronized to other equipment via MIDI.","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/ba/3a/ba3a51d8bc7b57a640ed8e4e762d85743b0b752e25ce20fce58f8a4f3105ef89.jpg","published":"2023-06-12T01:19:43+00:00","updated":"2023-07-16T22:52:58+00:00","followers":87,"time":1690112544176},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/NextDNS","title":"NextDNS","name":"NextDNS","preferred":"NextDNS","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"Magazine about NextDNS ad and tracking protection\r\n\r\nNextDNS Homepage\r\nNextDNS Support","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/media/0d/d2/0dd211b8866273927926865a95bc415b6ce7d1daa597a6e734ed6b97111588c6.png","published":"2023-06-24T13:08:16+00:00","updated":"2023-07-06T14:25:58+00:00","followers":7,"time":1690084766779},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/falconry","title":"Falconry","name":"falconry","preferred":"falconry","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"Discussion of the art and science of falconry from around the world.\nFalconry is defined as the possession and use of raptors for the pursuit of game.\r\n\r\nA Raptor is defined for the purpose of falconry as any bird in the orders of Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, and Strigiformes, possessing keen eyesight, powerful talons used to seize prey, and a sharp, curved beak used for tearing into prey.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\nThe Modern Apprentice\r\n\r\nNAFA Affiliated State Clubs","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-10T15:35:38+00:00","updated":"2023-06-20T06:01:49+00:00","followers":12,"time":1690113336516},{"actor_id":"https://fedia.io/m/Glasgow","title":"Glasgow","name":"Glasgow","preferred":"Glasgow","baseurl":"fedia.io","summary":"All subjects relating to Glasgow (Scotland) including casual chat","sensitive":false,"postingRestrictedToMods":false,"icon":null,"published":"2023-06-13T15:00:02+02:00","updated":"2023-06-13T15:02:28+02:00","followers":3,"time":1690083252171},{"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/worldbuilding","title":"Worldbuilding","name":"worldbuilding","preferred":"worldbuilding","baseurl":"kbin.social","summary":"The magazine dedicated to all sorts of worldbuilding antics!

That includes more than /g/ memes and slacking off. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual laziness.\r\n\r\nOff-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably lame.\r\n\r\nIn Submissions\r\n\r\nPlease do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or saying how great an article is. It should be explicit in submitting something that you think it's important.\r\n\r\nPlease don't submit the original source. If the article is behind a paywall, just post the text. If a video is behind a paywall, post a magnet link.\r\n\r\nIf the title includes the name of the site, please leave that in, because our users lack the intellect to know the difference between a url and a search query.\r\n\r\nIf you submit a video or pdf, please don't warn us by appending [video] or [pdf] to the title. We're not using text-based browsers. We know what videos and pdfs are.\r\n\r\nMake sure the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective. Good clickbait titles are like \"Top 10 Ways to do X\" or \"Don't do these 4 things if you want X\"\r\n\r\nOtherwise editorialize. Please don't use the original title, unless you're shits all fucked up.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to post old news (at least 1 year old), please flair it so we can mock you for living under a rock, or don't and we'll mock you anyway.\r\n\r\nPlease don't post on SN to ask or tell us something. Send it to hn@ycombinator.com instead.\r\n\r\nIf your post doesn't get enough traction, try to delete and repost it.\r\n\r\nPlease don't use SN primarily for promotion. It's ok to post your own stuff occasionally, but the primary use of the site should be for curiosity. If you want to astroturf or advertise, post on news.ycombinator.com instead.\r\n\r\nPlease solicit upvotes, comments, and submissions. Users are stupid and need to reminded to vote and interact. Thanks for the gold, kind stranger, upvotes to the left.\r\nIn Comments\r\nBe snarky. Have fun banter. Please don't use big words like \"fulminate\". Please seethe at the rest of the community.\r\n\r\nComments should get more enlightened and centrist, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to the weakest plausible strawman of what someone says, not a stronger one that's harder to make fun of. Assume that they are bad faith actors.\r\n\r\nEschew jailbait. Paedophiles will be thrown in a wood chipper, as pertained by sitewide rules.\r\n\r\nPlease post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. All press is good press.\r\n\r\nPlease use Slacker News for political or ideological battle. It tramples weak ideologies.\r\n\r\nPlease comment on whether someone read an article.\r\n\r\nPlease pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about in the thread. Don't nitpick stupid crap.\r\n\r\nPlease don't be an unfunny chud. Nobody cares about your opinion of X Unrelated Topic in Y Unrelated Thread. You will be banned and reported to administration.\r\n\r\nSockpuppet accounts are encouraged, but please don't farm karma.\r\n\r\nPlease use uppercase for emphasis.\r\n\r\nPlease post deranged conspiracy theories about astroturfing, shilling, bots, brigading, foreign agents and the like. It degrades discussion and is usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email hn@ycombinator.com and dang will add you to their spam list.\r\n\r\nPlease don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story is spam or off-topic, report it and our moderators will probably remove it. Feed egregious comments by replying instead of flagging them.\r\n\r\nPlease don't complain about tangential annoyances‚Äîthings like article or website formats, name collisions, or back-button breakage. That's too boring, even for HN users.\r\n\r\nPlease seethe about how your posts don't get enough upvotes.\r\n\r\nPlease don't post comments saying that lemmy is turning into reddit.\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\nWe reserve the right to ban you for whatever reason we want, even for no reason at all! We also reserve the right to change the guidelines at any time, so be sure to real them at least once a month. Be funny, or at least compelling, and pretty much anything legal is welcome provided it follows sitewide and you aren't a nazi.

The iconic '80s television sensation started out as the host of a British music video showcase, but quickly rose to fame through his trailblazing advertising campaigns for New Coke. His popularity led to a British TV movie, which in turn paved the way for his own prime-time series on ABC in 1987. The show's premise is a thrilling blend of sci-fi, satire, and comedy, with a dash of Blade Runner and Network thrown in for good measure. Despite its innovative nature, Max Headroom struggled to find an audience during its initial run, with only 14 episodes produced before it was cancelled. However, the show's impact has only grown over time, with its pop culture cachet earning it a spot on the cover of Newsweek and being parodied in Doonesbury.

Sometimes you have to enter the complete name you were looking for, and it better be spelled correctly. For example, \"David Bowi\" returns no results but \"David Bowie\" is on there. Also, you can only link to albums, not songs. Many songs have singles on Freegal where the song and album are the same, but that's not always the case. If a song is only on the full album, you can create a playlist containing only that song and then share a link to that playlist. Slightly annoying, but maybe less annoying than having everyone look through the album for the song.
